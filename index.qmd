# Simon Oiry {style="text-align: center"}
I'm a PhD student at the University of Nantes, France. As a drone pilot, I utilize this tool to map the intertidal areas along the Western-European coastlines. 

These areas harbor various types of vegetation, which can exhibit distinct taxonomies but sometimes share similar pigmentary compositions. This similarity in pigment composition among intertidal macrophytes poses a challenge in accurately discriminating them using remote sensing. 

Therefore, the objective of my PhD research is to identify effective methods for distinguishing macrophytes with similar pigment compositions using remote sensing.
