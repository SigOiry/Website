Iâ€™m Simon Oiry, a PhD student at the University of Nantes in France, specializing in the study of intertidal macrophytes. My research focuses on harnessing the power of remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral data from a spectroradiometer, as well as multispectral data from drones and satellites, to investigate these captivating coastal ecosystems.\nUsing a spectroradiometer, I collect hyperspectral data with high spectral resolution, allowing me to capture detailed information about the unique spectral signatures of intertidal macrophytes. In addition to hyperspectral data, I also leverage the capabilities of drones and satellites to acquire multispectral imagery. Drones equipped with multispectral sensors allow me to capture high-resolution data at a local scale, providing a detailed view of the intertidal areas. Furthermore, satellite multispectral data provide a broader perspective, enabling me to investigate macrophyte distributions and changes over larger spatial scales.\nBy combining these different data sources, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of intertidal macrophytes and their ecological dynamics. My research focuses on developing effective methods for analyzing and interpreting hyperspectral and multispectral data to discriminate between macrophyte species with similar pigment compositions.\nThrough my work, I strive to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of these critical coastal habitats. By monitoring and mapping the distribution and health of intertidal macrophytes, we can better understand their ecological roles and implement appropriate measures for their preservation."
