My research focuses on developing effective methods for analyzing and interpreting hyperspectral and multispectral data to discriminate between macrophyte species with similar pigment compositions.\nThrough my work, I strive to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of these critical coastal habitats.

    "text": "::: {.wrapper} ::: {.five} ::: {.grid}\n\n\n\n\nWhat is remote sensing ?\nRemote sensing is a method of gathering data about an object without being in direct contact with it. It’s like using satellites or drones to capture information from a distance. This could involve taking pictures (either in the visible or the infrared spectrum), measuring temperature, or even penetrating through clouds and vegetation to understand the terrain (with Lidar or Radar, for example). It’s a useful technique for studying the Earth, monitoring the environment, and making informed decisions about activities like agriculture, urban development, or environmental management.\nIn my case, I primarily use remote sensing to observe phenomena in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the wavelengths where the sun emits the majority of its energy. It is precisely within these wavelengths, know as Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), that plant pigments absorb light to carry out photosynthesis.\n\n:::\n\n\nSpectral resolution\nWhen discussing remote sensing, one of the most important technical characteristics is known as spectral resolution. Spectral resolution refers to the number of different “colors” (wavelengths) that a sensor can measure. We can distinguish between multispectral sensors, which can measure energy only in a few bands, and hyperspectral sensors, which are capable of recording energy in hundreds of bands. While hyperspectral data provides a more extensive set of information, it tends to be more difficult to process and typically noisier than multispectral data.\nIn my case, I mainly work with multispectral data because it is the most common type of data systematically acquired by satellite. Some products, like Sentinel-2, are freely accessible. When it comes to drones, the acquisition and processing of multispectral data are much less demanding compared to hyperspectral data. Furthermore, a recent publication has shown that the contribution of hyperspectral data was negligible in accurately discriminating some types of intertidal macrophytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n:::"

    "text": "DOI: 10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108033\nSeagrass meadows are monitored in the frame of several environmental programs worldwide, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), to evaluate the ecological status of European coastal and transitional water bodies. The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid-1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108432\nIn France, oyster aquaculture has been historically developed in intertidal zones, with shellfish farming areas covering much of the Atlantic coast. Monitoring these off-bottom cultures where oysters are grown in plastic mesh-bags set on trestle tables is mandatory for the maritime administration to check compliance with a Structural Plan Document (SPD), while also being important for stock assessment in relation to carrying capacity issues. However, traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inefficient in covering large intertidal areas. In this study, we used a new GIS-based analytical method to assess the potential of high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral data to retrieve spatial information on oyster-farming structures using Bourgneuf Bay (France) as a case-study. A non-parametric machine learning algorithm was applied to four UAV flight orthomosaics collected at different altitudes (12, 30, 50, and 120 m) to identify oyster mesh-bags. These supervised classifications achieved overall accuracies above 95% for all tested altitudes. In addition, an accurate distinction of oyster-bag mesh sizes (4, 9 and 14 mm) was obtained for 12–50 m flights, but there was a lower accuracy at 120 m. Across all flights, the 4 mm mesh size was the least well detected (72.14% Producer Accuracy). This information can be used to identify bags with specific mesh-sizes used for spat or adult grow out. Finally, we accurately measured oyster table heights using a high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. The 50 m flight was suggested as the best compromise to obtain precise measurements of the oyster table heights while covering larger areas than lower altitude flights. This demonstrates that UAV technology can provide a set of spatial variables relevant for shellfish farmers and coastal managers in an efficient, rapid, and non-destructive way to monitor the extent and characteristics of oyster-farming areas regularly."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.3390/rs14225857\nRemote sensing is a relevant method to map inaccessible areas, such as intertidal mudflats. However, image classification is challenging due to spectral similarity between microphytobenthos and oyster reefs. Because these elements are strongly related to local geomorphic features, including biogenic structures, a new mapping method has been developed to overcome the current obstacles. This method is based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), RGB, and multispectral (four bands: green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared) surveys that combine high spatial resolution (e.g., 5 cm pixel), geomorphic mapping, and machine learning random forest (RF) classification. A mudflat on the Atlantic coast of France (Marennes-Oléron bay) was surveyed based on this method and by using the structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetric approach to produce orthophotographs and digital surface models (DSM). Eight classes of mudflat surface based on indexes, such as NDVI and spectral bands normalised to NIR, were identified either on the whole image (i.e., standard RF classification) or after segmentation into five geomorphic units mapped from DSM (i.e., geomorphic-based RF classification). The classification accuracy was higher with the geomorphic-based RF classification (93.12%) than with the standard RF classification (73.45%), showing the added value of combining topographic and radiometric data to map soft-bottom intertidal areas and the user-friendly potential of this method in applications to other ecosystems, such as wetlands or peatlands."

    "text": "DOI: 10.1016/j.rse.2023.113554\nMonitoring biodiversity and how anthropogenic pressures impact this is critical, especially as anthropogenically driven climate change continues to affect all ecosystems. Intertidal areas are exposed to particularly high levelsof pressures owing to increased population density in coastal areas. Traditional methods of monitoring intertidalareas do not provide datasets with full coverage in a cost-effective or timely manner, and so the use of remotesensing to monitor these areas is becoming more common. Monitoring of ecologically important monospecifichabitats, such as seagrass beds, using remote sensing techniques is well documented. However, the ability formultispectral data to distinguish efficiently and accurately between classes of vegetation with similar pigmentcomposition, such as seagrass and green algae, has proved difficult, often requiring hyperspectral data. A machine learning approach was used to differentiate between soft-bottom intertidal vegetation classes whenexposed at low tide, comparing 6 different multi- and hyperspectral remote and in situ sensors. For the library of366 spectra, collected across Northern Europe, high accuracy (&gt;80%) was found across all spectral resolutions.While a higher spectral resolution resulted in higher accuracy, there was no discernible increase in accuracyabove 10 spectral bands (95%: Sentinel-2 MSI sensor with a spatial resolution of 20 m). This work highlights theability of multispectral sensors to discriminate intertidal vegetation types, while also showing the most importantwavelengths for this discrimination (~530 and ~ 730 nm), giving recommendations for spectral ranges of futuresatellite missions. The ability for multispectral sensors to aid in accurate and rapid intertidal vegetation classification at the taxonomic resolution of classes, could be a significant contribution for future sustainable andeffective ecosystem management."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107184\nMicrophytobenthos (MPB) is composed of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that colonize intertidal sediments within the first millimeters of the photic zone and form biofilms at low tide. In estuaries, this benthic group can represent the main primary producer and deliver several ecosystem services. However, it is not currently used as a bioindicator of water quality, contrary to the widespread use of phytobenthos in freshwater settings. This study assesses the potential of developing MBP metrics to assess water quality in transitional waters using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. A Random Forest machine learning classification was used to distinguish different types of intertidal vegetation in 26 French estuaries and bays, in particular MPB and green macroalgae (chlorophytes), using multispectral indices. High accuracy was generally achieved for the identification of MPB when compared with field validation data, for both User’s and Producer’s accuracies, which corresponded to 94% and 84% respectively. Two Earth observation variables were retrieved: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of MPB biomass, and MPB percent cover integrated over the entire intertidal area of the water body. From a total of 918 S2 images from over a full year, 28% were exploitable due to the combined requirements of cloud-free pixels collected during low tide. With its 10 m spatial resolution, S2 was able to map all estuaries. MPB percent cover showed a stronger gradient between estuaries than MPB NDVI. MPB percent cover was also significantly correlated with green macroalgae percent cover, and a group of estuaries characterized by the highest MPB and green macroalgae coverage corresponded to eutrophic sites impacted by intensive farming activities. A multivariate analysis confirmed that MPB percent cover was indeed related to nutrients. It was also related to sediment type which was one of the main factors underlying differences between estuaries. This work is a first step toward a water quality metric using MPB, and several recommendations are proposed to refine this approach. Sentinel-2 imagery, which is publicly available, presents an interesting compromise to map estuarine microphytobenthos in order to assess the ecological status of transitional waters."

This area is primarily vegetated by algae and a few flowering plant species. The problem lies in the fact that some of these plants share a similar pigment composition. This means that they reflect more or less the same colors, which is technically referred to as having the same spectral signature. This poses a challenge when attempting to differentiate between these vegetation types using remote sensing because color is the only information that is measured by this technique.\nTherefore,my objective is to find advanced methods based machine learning to effectively distinguish between intertidal vegetation.\n\n\n\nWhat is remote sensing ?\nRemote sensing is a method of gathering data about an object without being in direct contact with it.

My research focuses on harnessing the power of remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral data from a spectroradiometer, as well as multispectral data from drones and satellites, to investigate these captivating coastal ecosystems.\nUsing a spectroradiometer, I collect hyperspectral data with high spectral resolution, allowing me to capture detailed information about the unique spectral signatures of intertidal macrophytes. In addition to hyperspectral data, I also leverage the capabilities of drones and satellites to acquire multispectral imagery. Drones equipped with multispectral sensors allow me to capture high-resolution data at a local scale, providing a detailed view of the intertidal areas. Furthermore, satellite multispectral data provide a broader perspective, enabling me to investigate macrophyte distributions and changes over larger spatial scales.\nBy combining these different data sources, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of intertidal macrophytes and their ecological dynamics. My research focuses on developing effective methods for analyzing and interpreting hyperspectral and multispectral data to discriminate between macrophyte species with similar pigment compositions.\nThrough my work, I strive to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of these critical coastal habitats. By monitoring and mapping the distribution and health of intertidal macrophytes, we can better understand their ecological roles and implement appropriate measures for their preservation."

    "text": "Multiscale remote sensing of intertidal vegetation of European coasts in response to natural and anthropogenic pressures.\n\n\nHabitats formed by marine vegetation in intertidal zones that are exposed at low tide (seagrass beds, microphytobenthos, macroalgae) are heavily impacted by human activities. Seagrass beds are threatened by numerous anthropogenic activities (McKenzie et al., 2020), microphytobenthos is affected by the global decrease in intertidal mudflats (Murray et al., 2019), and the expansion of wild oysters may have reduced the areas colonized by macroalgae (Le Bris et al., 2016). These habitats fulfill recognized ecological functions, including protection against coastal erosion, mitigation of eutrophication effects, absorption of atmospheric CO2, and acting as biodiversity hotspots that support specific flora and fauna.\nHowever, intertidal zones, such as mudflats, are challenging to access, and traditional field sampling would require excessive time and effort to cover the target areas. Nonetheless, regulatory requirements for monitoring the ecological status of coastal marine habitats necessitate regular mapping. This is the case with the Water Framework Directive (WFD) or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), which use the diversity of marine habitats as bioindicators of coastal or estuarine water quality (Borja et al., 2013; Zoffoli et al., 2021).\n\n\nSpatial remote sensing is an innovative tool for studying essential variables for the biodiversity of these habitats (Peirera et al., 2013; Skidmore et al., 2015). However, past and current satellite missions do not possess optimal technical characteristics (spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution) to be fully operational (Muller-Karger et al., 2018). For some habitats, multispectral resolution may be sufficient under certain conditions (Zoffoli et al., 2020), but there are still risks of confusion. For others, higher resolution or the presence of specific spectral bands is essential for distinguishing taxonomically distinct organism classes (Fyfe et al., 2003; Launeau et al., 2018; Méléder et al., 2018). The identification principle relies, in part, on the presence of absorption bands in the visible spectrum related to the presence of photosynthetic and accessory pigments, which can be detected and quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography (Méléder et al., 2003, 2005; Bargain et al., 2013; Jesus et al., 2014). The analysis of the phenology of these organisms could also be exploited to aid in their discrimination.\nWith its revisit time of 3 to 5 days, the Sentinel 2 satellite can also help identify seasonal cycles of marine vegetation (Zoffoli et al., 2020). Temporal variations in intertidal vegetation have been less documented than spatial variations, mainly due to the limited availability of high-resolution satellite images (e.g., SPOT, LANDSAT) and the constraints of acquiring images at low tide related to the study object. Therefore, there is currently no sensor that can provide high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions simultaneously. Consequently, this thesis will employ a multi-sensor analysis (Sentinel 2; MODIS) and will notably utilize very high-resolution spatial mapping using drones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives are related to mapping the spatiotemporal variations of plant biodiversity in intertidal zones through remote sensing, particularly using the Sentinel 2 satellite. The aim is to analyze the main natural and anthropogenic factors responsible for these changes. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that remote sensing can meet the regulatory requirement for monitoring the ecological status of habitats of community interest (Papathanasopoulou et al., 2019) and that marine angiosperms could be used as an indicator of water quality."

    "text": "My PhD\nThe aim of my doctoral research is to map the vegetation that grows in the zone comprised between high and low tide, known as the intertidal zone. This area is primarily vegetated by algae and a few flowering plant species. The problem lies in the fact that some of these plants share a similar pigment composition. This means that they reflect more or less the same colors, which is technically referred to as having the same spectral signature. This poses a challenge when attempting to differentiate between these vegetation types using remote sensing because color is the only information that is measured by this technique.\nTherefore,my objective is to find advanced methods based machine learning to effectively distinguish between intertidal vegetation.\n\n\n\nWhat is remote sensing ?\nRemote sensing is a method of gathering data about an object without being in direct contact with it. It’s like using satellites or drones to capture information from a distance. This could involve taking pictures (either in the visible or the infrared spectrum), measuring temperature, or even penetrating through clouds and vegetation to understand the terrain (with Lidar or Radar, for example). It’s a useful technique for studying the Earth, monitoring the environment, and making informed decisions about activities like agriculture, urban development, or environmental management.\nIn my case, I primarily use remote sensing to observe phenomena in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically the wavelengths where the sun emits the majority of its energy. It is precisely within these wavelengths, know as Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), that plant pigments absorb light to carry out photosynthesis.\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution\nWhen discussing remote sensing, one of the most important technical characteristics is known as spectral resolution. Spectral resolution refers to the number of different “colors” (wavelengths) that a sensor can measure. We can distinguish between multispectral sensors, which can measure energy only in a few bands, and hyperspectral sensors, which are capable of recording energy in hundreds of bands. While hyperspectral data provides a more extensive set of information, it tends to be more difficult to process and typically noisier than multispectral data.\nIn my case, I mainly work with multispectral data because it is the most common type of data systematically acquired by satellite. Some products, like Sentinel-2, are freely accessible. When it comes to drones, the acquisition and processing of multispectral data are much less demanding compared to hyperspectral data. Furthermore, a recent publication has shown that the contribution of hyperspectral data was negligible in accurately discriminating some types of intertidal macrophytes."

    "title": "Remote sensing in seagrass ecology: coupled dynamics between migratory herbivorous birds and intertidal meadows observed by satellite during four decades",
    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.1002/rse2.319\nTaking into account trophic relationships in seagrass meadows is crucial to explain and predict seagrass temporal trajectories, as well as for implementing and evaluating seagrass conservation policies. However, this type of interaction has been rarely investigated over the long term and at the scale of the whole seagrass habitat. In this work, reciprocal links between an intertidal seagrass species, Zostera noltei, and a herbivorous bird feeding on this seagrass species, the migratory goose Branta bernicla bernicla, were investigated using an original combination of long-term Earth Observation (EO) and bird census data. Seagrass Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) such as seagrass abundance and phenology were measured from 1985 to 2020 using high-resolution satellite remote sensing over Bourgneuf Bay (France), and cross-analysed with in situ measurements of bird population size during the goose wintering season. Our results showed a mutual relationship between seagrass and Brent geese over the four last decades, suggesting that the relationship between the two species extends beyond a simple grass-herbivore consumptive effect. We provided evidence of two types of interactions: (i) a bottom-up control where the latesummer seagrass abundance drives the wintering population of herbivorous geese and (ii) an indirect top-down effect of Brent goose on seagrass habitat, where seagrass development is positively influenced by the bird population during the previous wintering season. Such a mutualistic relationship has strong implications for biodiversity conservation because protecting one species is beneficial to the other one, as demonstrated here by the positive trajectories observed from 1985 to 2020 in both seagrass and bird populations. Importantly, we also demonstrated here that exploring the synergy between EO and in situ bird data can benefit seagrass ecology and ecosystem management."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.3390/rs15143674\nThe aquaculture of Kappaphycus alvarezii (Kappaphycus hereafter) seaweed has rapidly expanded among coastal communities in Indonesia due to its relatively simple farming process, low capital costs and short production cycles. This species is mainly cultivated for its carrageenan content used as a gelling agent in the food industry. To further assist producers in improving cultivation management and providing quantitative information about the yield, a novel approach involving remote sensing techniques was tested. In this study, multispectral images obtained from a drone (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle, UAV) were processed to estimate the fresh and carrageenan weights of Kappaphycus at a cultivation site in South Sulawesi. The UAV imagery was geometrically and radiometrically corrected, and the resulting orthomosaics were used for detecting and classifying Kappaphycus using a random forest algorithm. The classification results were combined with in situ measurements of Kappaphycus fresh weight and carrageenan content using empirical relations between the area and weight of fresh seaweed/carrageenan. This approach allowed quantifying seaweed biometry and biochemistry at single cultivation lines and cultivation plot scales. Fresh seaweed and carrageenan weights were estimated for different dates within three distinct cultivation cycles, and the daily growth rate for each cycle was derived. Data were upscaled to a small family-scale farm and a large-scale leader farm and compared with previous estimations. To our knowledge, this study provides, for the first time, an estimation of yield at the scale of cultivation lines by exploiting the very high spatial resolution of drone data. Overall, the use of UAV remote sensing proved to be a promising approach for seaweed monitoring, opening the way to precision aquaculture of Kappaphycus."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149983\nMicrophytobenthos (MPB) provides important ecosystem functions and services, contributing significantly to the total primary production in shallow coastal ecosystems. However, determining the factors that regulate the seasonal changes of MPB and its distribution patterns at larger scales is hindered by the considerable spatial and temporal variability in these environments. Here, we studied the dynamics of intertidal MPB biomass, cover, and net growth rates in a south European tidal flat (Cadiz Bay, Spain) over a four-year period using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Pixels dominated by different benthic communities (MPB, Zostera sp., Caulerpa sp. and green macroalgae) were identified at a 10-m resolution using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithm. MPB dominated the intertidal zone. MPB cover did not show a clear seasonal pattern and was clearly higher in the middle of the intertidal range of sea level. Despite interannual variability, MPB biomass was always higher during winter, coinciding with observations from other low latitude intertidal flats with temperate climate, and in the upper-middle intertidal. Net rates of MPB biomass change, calculated from the differences in MPB NDVI over time, showed maximal net growth rates from autumn to winter and maximum loss rates during spring and summer, although with high variability. Our study demonstrates that RF algorithms allow mapping MPB and other intertidal communities from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery accurately obtaining invaluable information from large areas at very high spatio-temporal resolution. The dissimilarities observed in the patterns of MPB variables over time or sea level, indicate differences in their ecological regulation, still largely unknown both here and in other temperate climate intertidal flats. High resolution remote sensing can aid in their detailed and systematic study producing a more integrated view of these systems and contributing to their science-based management and conservation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "DOI: 10.3390/rs14020307\nIn temperate coastal regions of Western Europe, the polychaete Sabellaria alveolata (Linné) builds large intertidal reefs of several hectares on soft-bottom substrates. These reefs are protected by the European Habitat Directive EEC/92/43 under the status of biogenic structures hosting a high biodiversity and providing ecological functions such as protection against coastal erosion. As an alternative to time-consuming field campaigns, a UAV-based Structure-from-Motion photogrammetric survey was carried out in October 2020 over Noirmoutier Island (France) where the second-largest known European reef is located in a tidal delta. A DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral UAV provided a topographic dataset at very high resolutions of 5 cm/pixel for the Digital Surface Model (DSM) and 2.63 cm/pixel for the multispectral orthomosaic images. The reef footprint was mapped using a combination of two topographic indices: the Topographic Openness Index and the Topographic Position Index. The reef structures covered an area of 8.15 ha, with 89% corresponding to the main reef composed of connected and continuous biogenic structures, 7.6% of large isolated structures (&lt;60 m2), and 4.4% of small isolated reef clumps (&lt;2 m2). To further describe the topographic complexity of the reef, the Geomorphon landform classification was used. The spatial distribution of tabular platforms considered as a healthy stage of the reef in contrast to a degraded stage was mapped with a proxy that consists in comparing the reef volume to a theoretical tabular-shaped reef volume. Epibionts colonizing the reef (macroalgae, mussels, and oysters) were also mapped by combining multispectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and simple band ratios with topographic indices. A confusion matrix showed that macroalgae and mussels were satisfactorily identified but that oysters could not be detected by an automated procedure due to their spectral complexity. The topographic indices used in this work should now be further exploited to propose a health index for these large intertidal reefs."
