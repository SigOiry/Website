    "text": "Welcome to my website !\nI’m Simon Oiry, a PhD student at the University of Nantes in France, specializing in the study of intertidal macrophytes. My research focuses on harnessing the power of remote sensing to investigate these captivating coastal ecosystems.\nOn this website, I will share everything related to my work, including the ecological, scientific, and technical aspects. Here, I share information about the scientific projects I am currently working on and have worked on in the past, as well as the various publications I have been involved in. I will also share all the coding, GIS, and remote sensing experiences I have acquired during my years as a research engineer and doctoral student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy PhD\nThe aim of my doctoral research is to map the vegetation that grows in the zone between high tide and low tide, which is completely exposed at low tide (it’s called intertidal zone). This area is primarily inhabited by algae and a few flowering plants. The problem lies in the fact that some of these plants share very similar pigment compositions. This means that they absorb and reflect more or less the same colors (we say they have the same spectral signature). This poses a challenge when attempting to differentiate between these plants using remote sensing because color is the only information that can be retrieved through remote sensing.\nTherefore, I am trying to find machine learning methods that can effectively differentiate these plants with similar pigment compositions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is remote sensing ?\nRemote sensing is a method of gathering data about something without physically being in contact with it. It’s like using satellites or drones to capture information from a distance. This could involve taking pictures (either in the visible or the infrared spectrum), measuring temperature, or even penetrating through clouds and vegetation to understand the terrain (with Lidar or Radar for example). It’s a useful technique for studying the Earth, monitoring the environment, and making informed decisions about things like agriculture, urban development, or environmental management.\nIn my case, I primarily use remote sensing to observe what is happening in the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is in these wavelengths that the sun emits the majority of its energy. And it is precisely in these wavelengths that plant pigments absorb light (known as photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR) to carry out photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution\nWhen we talk about remote sensing, one of the most important technical characteristics is what we call spectral resolution. It is so crucial that depending on the spectral resolution, we distinguish between multispectral remote sensing and hyperspectral remote sensing. Spectral resolution basically determines the number of different “colors” (wavelengths) that a sensor measures. Hyperspectral sensors have a very high spectral resolution, but they generate heavy, difficult-to-process, and noisy data. In contrast, multispectral sensors are easier to deploy, generate less data, but have a lower spectral resolution.\nIn my case, I mainly work with multispectral data because it is the most common type of data in remote sensing. Some products, like Sentinel-2, are freely accessible. When it comes to drones, compared to hyperspectral data, the acquisition and processing of multispectral data are much less demanding. Furthermore, a recent publication has shown that the contribution of hyperspectral data was negligible in accurately discriminating intertidal macrophytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Welcome to my website! I’m Simon Oiry, a PhD student at the University of Nantes in France, specializing in the study of intertidal macrophytes. My research focuses on harnessing the power of remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral data from a spectroradiometer, as well as multispectral data from drones and satellites, to investigate these captivating coastal ecosystems.\nUsing a spectroradiometer, I collect hyperspectral data with high spectral resolution, allowing me to capture detailed information about the unique spectral signatures of intertidal macrophytes. In addition to hyperspectral data, I also leverage the capabilities of drones and satellites to acquire multispectral imagery. Drones equipped with multispectral sensors allow me to capture high-resolution data at a local scale, providing a detailed view of the intertidal areas. Furthermore, satellite multispectral data provide a broader perspective, enabling me to investigate macrophyte distributions and changes over larger spatial scales.\nBy combining these different data sources, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of intertidal macrophytes and their ecological dynamics. My research focuses on developing effective methods for analyzing and interpreting hyperspectral and multispectral data to discriminate between macrophyte species with similar pigment compositions.\nThrough my work, I strive to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of these critical coastal habitats. By monitoring and mapping the distribution and health of intertidal macrophytes, we can better understand their ecological roles and implement appropriate measures for their preservation."

    "text": "Video\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website !\nI’m Simon Oiry, a PhD student at the University of Nantes in France, specializing in the study of intertidal macrophytes. My research focuses on harnessing the power of remote sensing to investigate these captivating coastal ecosystems.\nOn this website, I will share everything related to my work, including the ecological, scientific, and technical aspects. Here, I share information about the scientific projects I am currently working on and have worked on in the past, as well as the various publications I have been involved in. I will also share all the coding, GIS, and remote sensing experiences I have acquired during my years as a research engineer and doctoral student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy PhD\nThe aim of my doctoral research is to map the vegetation that grows in the zone between high tide and low tide, which is completely exposed at low tide (it’s called intertidal zone). This area is primarily inhabited by algae and a few flowering plants. The problem lies in the fact that some of these plants share very similar pigment compositions. This means that they absorb and reflect more or less the same colors (we say they have the same spectral signature). This poses a challenge when attempting to differentiate between these plants using remote sensing because color is the only information that can be retrieved through remote sensing.\nTherefore, I am trying to find machine learning methods that can effectively differentiate these plants with similar pigment compositions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is remote sensing ?\nRemote sensing is a method of gathering data about something without physically being in contact with it. It’s like using satellites or drones to capture information from a distance. This could involve taking pictures (either in the visible or the infrared spectrum), measuring temperature, or even penetrating through clouds and vegetation to understand the terrain (with Lidar or Radar for example). It’s a useful technique for studying the Earth, monitoring the environment, and making informed decisions about things like agriculture, urban development, or environmental management.\nIn my case, I primarily use remote sensing to observe what is happening in the visible and near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is in these wavelengths that the sun emits the majority of its energy. And it is precisely in these wavelengths that plant pigments absorb light (known as photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR) to carry out photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\nSpectral resolution\nWhen we talk about remote sensing, one of the most important technical characteristics is what we call spectral resolution. It is so crucial that depending on the spectral resolution, we distinguish between multispectral remote sensing and hyperspectral remote sensing. Spectral resolution basically determines the number of different “colors” (wavelengths) that a sensor measures. Hyperspectral sensors have a very high spectral resolution, but they generate heavy, difficult-to-process, and noisy data. In contrast, multispectral sensors are easier to deploy, generate less data, but have a lower spectral resolution.\nIn my case, I mainly work with multispectral data because it is the most common type of data in remote sensing. Some products, like Sentinel-2, are freely accessible. When it comes to drones, compared to hyperspectral data, the acquisition and processing of multispectral data are much less demanding. Furthermore, a recent publication has shown that the contribution of hyperspectral data was negligible in accurately discriminating intertidal macrophytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo"
