    "text": "Simon Oiry\nI’m a PhD student at the University of Nantes, France. As a drone pilot, I utilize this tool to map the intertidal areas along the Western-European coastlines.\nThese areas harbor various types of vegetation, which can exhibit distinct taxonomies but sometimes share similar pigmentary compositions. This similarity in pigment composition among intertidal macrophytes poses a challenge in accurately discriminating them using remote sensing.\nTherefore, the objective of my PhD research is to identify effective methods for distinguishing macrophytes with similar pigment compositions using remote sensing.\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Twitter\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email"
